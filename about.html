Looking for a phD program somewhere in this planet!<br>
There is probably no such profession like a ”medical computer scientist” but it is close to what I
do now. It is extremely fascinating to me to understand and use the concepts from medicine and
computer science. What I am trying to do is to investigate human perception and behavior from both
biological and computational perspectives with help of neuro-imaging techniques like EEG and fMRI.
By modelling these processes and simulations, I would like to further understand their underlying
mechanism, which cannot be achieved with only empirical data.
Growing up in a developing country, I am also keen on using DIY (do-it-yourself) experimental devices
(movement sensors, IR cameras for eye tracking, etc.) and open source programing (C++, Python) in
order to lift the boundary between ”the haves and the have nots”.<br>
